I created a route-verifying web application for the Maynooth University Algorithms and Data Structures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman</a> optimisation problem which is run every year. The class previously used a Java web applet for this purpose. It uses the Google Maps API to give visual feedback such as drawing the route on a map of Ireland and colouring the background to match valid/invalid routes. It also lists the problems with invalid routes and calculates the distance of any route entered. It has been approved for use by the class and can be visited <a href="http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~ahealy/tsp_checker/">here</a>.
