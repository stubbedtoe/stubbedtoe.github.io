I designed the April and September (2012) and June (2013) issues of <em><a href="http://www.thewearyblues.org">The Weary Blues</a></em>
 - a digital journal of poetry, art, photography, and short fiction. The
 journal is available for free download (as either print or 
screen-friendly pdf) <a href="http://thewearyblues.org/publication-history/">here</a>. The September issue is also available as an iBook for the iPad. The intro media for the iPad version can be viewed <a href="http://vimeo.com/51090276">here</a>.
