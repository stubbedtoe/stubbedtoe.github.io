Personal website about colour/color (the spelling of the word can be changed by the user). I created this site to put into practice some of the web design features I was interested in as well as some features required by a university project: HTML5 location APIs and local storage, embedding Processing sketches to interact with external elements and scripts, CSS animations, etc. The site can be visited at <a href="http://andrewhealy.com/color-colour/">andrewhealy.com/color-colour/</a>
