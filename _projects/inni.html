Northern Ireland's geography is still highly politicised in spite of the
 relative peace of recent years. Communities often show solidarity, mark their territory, and express 
identity through the display of flags, bunting and murals. As such, colour is an 
important signifier of political allegiance. The words Orange or Green 
when applied to a person or area take on political or social 
significance.</p>

</p>By using a strict series of gradients determined by 
latitude and longitude values rather than the demographics of an area, 
the "in N.I." app converts any given point in Northern Ireland into a 
new colour. This colour is joined by its contrasting colour at all times
 (reflecting the two communities living together).</p>

<p>While this app is mostly about creating an objective and neutral 
colour map for Northern Ireland, at 124 sites across the British Isles 
the app will respond directly to that location's significance in the 
Troubles. The animation changes from slowly intersecting circles to 
rapidly flashing squares and the date of the incident in question 
appears on screen. No other details are given (about victims or group 
responsible, for example). It is left up to the user if they want to 
conduct their own search for the particular event.</p>
