Commission from independent production company <em>Shoot For The Moon</em>
 to create a short moving graphic logo for the start of their 
productions. They wanted an urban sky scape with a heightened sense of 
reality which reflected their optimistic name. An enjoyable feature of 
this project was the opportunity to do some architectural drawing.
