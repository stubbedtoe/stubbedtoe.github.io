This installation consisted of three photocopy solvent transfers and a
 stack of photocopies. The solvent transfers used screen grabs from 
Google Earth and Sketchup models to depict supposed missile launchers 
and other suspicious activities in Smithfield Square. The viewer was 
welcome to take home a photocopy of a Wikipedia page describing the 
Smithfield Missile Crisis. You can get your copy <a href="http://virtualsurface.tumblr.com/post/587610951">here</a>.</p>
