My submission to the <!--<a href="http://runcomputerrun.com/?page_id=8313">-->Economics and the Immaterial<!--</a>-->
 exhibition was based on recent developments in using 3d printers to 
make gun components (now even entire guns, apparently). I created a 
simplified 3d model of the Lower Receiver part of the AR-15 assault 
rifle (the first successfully printed firearm part, as developed by <a href="https://defdist.org/">Defence Distibuted</a>'s
 Cody Wilson et al) with animated textures. All my pieces had a slight 
colloquial 90s internet aesthetic to reference the social history of the
 technology that is making these guns a reality and the Wilson quote 
below. </p>

<p><em>“I don't think we're Utopians, I think the real Utopia is the 
idea that we can go back to the 1990s and everything will be perfect 
forever” <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA#t=1408">source</a></em> </p>

<p>The exhibition consisted of the 'Layar' codes printed and stuck on the wall. A selection of goods designed by each artist were available to buy from the website: t-shirts, tote-bags, posters and postcards.</p>
