For the opening of Mart's Rathmines studio, the <a href="http://www.mart.ie/portfolios/curb-your-carrie-bradshawism/" title="MART site">Curb your Carriebradshawism</a> exhibition invited artists to make their contribution fit within a 60cm<sup>3</sup> brown cardboard box - using any medium. I made a pop-up structure that was collapsible and easily storable. The patterned silver foil reflected the light and the matte black paint formed a perfect circle when viewed from a particular angle. I wanted to play with dimensionality, reflection and absorption of light, anamorphic imagery and temporary structures, among other things.
