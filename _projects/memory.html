A simple memory game built with Processing to create awareness of 
alcohol-related blackouts. I wanted to re-create the sense of 
disconnection between seeing photographs of a night's events and the 
actual memory of the events. The game can be played <a href="http://www.andrewhealy.com/memory_gamble/">here</a>. (Shortlisted for 2011 Dare2BDrinkAware: Best Multimedia)
