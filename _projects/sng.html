<em>Stitch'n'Glitch</em> is an application to aid the experimentation of
 mixing image corruption with traditional cross stitch techniques. 
Images can be uploaded to the application, colours can be reduced 
(through dithering or otherwise) before or after glitching. Export 
options include pdf vector image, CSV file of hexadecimal values or pdf 
cross stitch pattern, of course.</p>
 <p>The project has its own mini-site at <a href="http://stitch-n-glitch.com/">stitch-n-glitch.com</a> where there is much more information, images, downloads and links.</p>
<p>Version 1 (2012) of this application can still be downloaded from the mini-site <a href="http://www.andrewhealy.com/stitch-n-glitch/">here</a>. The code for this version is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/craftoid/Stitch_n_Glitch">this GitHub page</a>. The second version (2013) of the software added the ability to glitch and dither even large images, export patterns as multi-page PDFs with simplified colour symbols, more dithering algorithms and improved User 
Interaction. It can be downloaded <a href="http://www.stitch-n-glitch.com/version2/">here</a>. Code for all versions is hosted on my own <a href="https://github.com/stubbedtoe">github</a>.</p>
<p>Image corruption code adapted from the <a href="http://www.recyclism.com/corrupt.php">corrupt</a> project by <a href="http://www.recyclism.com/">Recyclism</a>.
