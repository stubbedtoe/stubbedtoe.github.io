From 2009-2015, <em>Tonia Larem</em> (an anagram of "I am not real") was the name of
an on-going investigation into online identity. An open-source
personality: the username and password to her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tonia.larem">Facebook account</a> was
 freely available to let anybody participate under an assumed identity
and with complete anonymity. Unfortunately, her account was maliciously deactivated in 2015 without my knowledge. I was by no means responsible for what Tonia
 did on facebook (some of which I disagreed with) but I have used her
for a number of real-life and virtual exhibitions/projects and encourage
 others to use her in any way they wish when a fictional character is
appropriate.</p>

Some of those projects have been documented on the site <a href="http://tonia.stitch-n-glitch.com/">A Home of Sorts for Tonia Larem</a>
